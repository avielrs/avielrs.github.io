### Profile
From earthquake scientist to data scientist, I jumped into this career switch when I realized my passion for working with data, and my curiosity for how data creates transparency, growth, and productive decisions within communities. As a Data Scientist, I am driven to extract essential information through data engineering, data analysis, and machine learning, and to then tell a story through data visualizations. I am enthusiastic to apply data science in real-world applications within businesses and to make an impact within my community through data findings.
