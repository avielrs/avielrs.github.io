### Profile
Hello World! 

I am a Data Scientist located in Toronto, Ontario. I am originally from San Jose, CA and a 90’s kid which means I grew up going to the mall and eating glorious burritos.  Growing up in California, I was always mesmerized when my mom shared her experience of what it was like to live through the Loma Prieta 1989 earthquake. 

Due to my draw towards earthquakes, natural disasters, and of course beautiful ROCKS! I attended University of California, Santa Cruz for a Bachelor of Science in [Earth Science](https://eps.ucsc.edu/). There I got my hands dirty in geology with lots of experience such as field mapping, analysis through LiDAR Imagery, ArcGIS, measuring the hydraulic flow, and my personal favorite: identifying faults and analyzing their mechanical properties. My senior year, I worked with [Brodsky Seismology Lab](https://websites.pmc.ucsc.edu/~seisweb/emily_brodsky/) where I ran torsional rheometer experiments on Santa Cruz beach sand and recorded the acoustic vibrations of the sand particles. The goal of these experiments provided insights into the fault weakening mechanism justp before an earthquake rupture. This can help us determine why an earthquake rupture is unexpectedly greater than predicted. 

I then joined [Michele Cook’s Geomechanics Lab](https://blogs.umass.edu/cooke/) at [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](https://www.geo.umass.edu/) where I received a Master of Science.  My graduate research assistantship focused on the evolution of fault growth through Numerical and Analog modelling.  
After graduating at UMass Amherst, I worked at OriginLab in Technical Support where I gained 2 years of Data Analytics and Data Visualization experience. In January 2020, I decided to take the jump into Data Science which is something I had been considering since graduating from graduate school. I attended BrainStation Data Science diploma program in Toronto. There I fell in love with Data! We worked on many hands-on projects in SQL, Tableau, Python and AWS. 

At BrainStation, I worked on cross-functional teams within a hackathon challenge, and I met with a scrum group with agile workflow deliverables. Homework assignments included data cleaning, EDA, machine learning, NLP, answering business type questions such as using Bixi bike data in SQL to gain an understanding of how people use Bixi bikes and determine what factors influence the volume of usage, popular stations and overall business growth. I as well fit a statistical model to predict the 2016 relative vote share of the Republican party within a county using the county-level demographic data, and for another assignment I optimize hyperparameters in order to improve accuracy score for logistic regression, KNN, and decision tree models on Hotel Reviews. 

Things that I love to do are swimming, hiking, dancing, and baking the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookie.
