### Profile
Hello World! 

I'm Aviel Stern and this is my blog in hopes for you to get to know me better, to make new connections, and share interests.

I am a Data Scientist located in Toronto, Ontario. I am originally from San Jose, CA and a 90’s kid which means I grew up going to the mall and eating glorious burritos.  Growing up in California, I was always mesmerized when my mom shared her experience of what it was like to live through the Loma Prieta 1989 earthquake. 

Due to my draw towards earthquakes, natural disasters, and of course beautiful ROCKS! I attended University of California, Santa Cruz for a Bachelor of Science in [Earth Science](https://eps.ucsc.edu/). There I got my hands dirty in geology with lots of experience such as field mapping, analysis through LiDAR Imagery, ArcGIS, measuring the hydraulic flow, and my personal favorite: identifying faults and analyzing their mechanical properties! My senior year, I worked with [Brodsky Seismology Lab](https://websites.pmc.ucsc.edu/~seisweb/emily_brodsky/) where I ran torsional rheometer experiments on Santa Cruz beach sand and recorded the acoustic vibrations of the sand particles. The goal of these experiments provided insights into the fault weakening mechanism just before an earthquake ruptures. This research help us determine why an earthquake might unexpectly rupture at a greater strength than predicted. After playing with beach sand, I went on to working with wet kaolin clay and boundary element method models! Yay!

I joined [Michele Cook’s Geomechanics Lab](https://blogs.umass.edu/cooke/) at [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](https://www.geo.umass.edu/) where I received a Master of Science degree in Geoscience with a focus in Geomchanics (Rock Mechanics/Fault Mechanics). My graduate research assistantship focused on the evolution of fault growth through numerical and analog models. There I gained skills in the use of Linux, MATLAB, Perl, Poly3D (Boundary Element Method), 3DMove, Adobe Illustrator, and in technical writing, and presenting work professionally. At UMass Amherst, I gained the analytical and technical skills needed for me to be able to pursue a career in Data Science. I as well gained fundamental knowledge into developing a robust model through validating and verifying model results and making sure that the boundary conditions are setup correctly in a model.

After graduating at UMass Amherst, I worked at OriginLab in Technical Support where I gained 2 years of Data Analytics and Data Visualization experience. In January 2020, I decided to take the jump into Data Science which is something I had been considering since graduating from graduate school. I attended [BrainStation Data Science diploma program](https://brainstation.io/course/toronto/data-science?utm_keyword=%2Bdata%20%2Bscience%20%2Bbrainstation&utm_network=g&utm_matchtype=b&utm_creative=269262450377&utm_target=&utm_placement=&utm_device=c&utm_campaign=649120212&utm_adgroup=56812219833&utm_source=AdWords&utm_target_id=aud-808969644948:kwd-447159192211&gclid=CjwKCAjwr7X4BRA4EiwAUXjbt1bHVW-84_FdNTiQ422xDxWVGr7ik7GTnO2WNeOjhojI6AxhSzdKqRoCg-wQAvD_BwE) in Toronto. At BrainStation I fell in love with Data! We worked on many hands-on projects in SQL, Tableau, Python and AWS. 

At BrainStation, I worked on cross-functional teams within a hackathon challenge, and I met with a scrum group where we needed to provide agile workflow deliverables. Homework assignments included data cleaning, EDA, machine learning, NLP, answering business type questions such as using Bixi bike data in SQL to gain an understanding of how people use Bixi bikes and determine what factors influence the volume of usage, popular stations and overall business growth. I as well fit a statistical model to predict the 2016 relative vote share of the Republican party within a county using the county-level demographic data. For another assignment I optimize hyperparameters in order to improve accuracy scores for logistic regression, KNN, and decision tree models on Hotel Reviews. 

Things that I love to do are swimming, hiking, dancing, and baking the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. I as well co-created [Tasty Chicks Comedy](www.tastychickscomedy.com).
