# Part 3A: Text Preprocessing for Topic Modelling
 
I love the word Lemmatization because the syllables, consonants, and vowels that make up the word lemmatization form a sound that makes me smile. I like Natural Language Processing (NLP) because I like to think about languages as a structure, pattern, and rhythm. Through this process, I can take a sentence and visualize it. Like a fun puzzle, languages are messy at first, but a comprehensive picture forms when the right pieces fit together.
 
I remember sitting in my high school English literature class with multiple sentences written on the board. We broke down each sentence and identified part of speech to understand how a word’s structure influences a sentence’s meaning. The act of breaking down a sentence to understand the structure falls under the discipline of linguistics.  While as individuals, we can break down sentences and identify meaning, it becomes difficult and almost impossible to do so with large text documents such as 100,000,000 tweets or 100,000 news articles. <br> <br>
